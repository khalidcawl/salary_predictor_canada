# Code of Conduct

### Our intention
This project aims at helping programmers, both graduates and experienced ones, match their salary expections. We as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community with a more equal working environment for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

### Our standards
Every contributor has the right to have their identity respected. This project is dedicated to providing a positive experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, or religion (or lack thereof), education, or socio-economic status.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery
- Personal attacks
- Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing other's private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission
- Other unethical or unprofessional conduct

### Our responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. If a group member is violating any of the expectations outlined in this document please bring the incident to the attention of the current project maintainers as [Jiwei Hu](mailto:jinglu_cui@163.com), [Sanchit Singh](mailto:jinglu_cui@163.com), [Khalid Abdilahi](mailto:jinglu_cui@163.com) and [Vera Cui](mailto:jinglu_cui@163.com).

### Scope
This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.
